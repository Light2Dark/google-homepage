# google-homepage
Hiii!
My name is Shahmir. Im learning how to build a website... ya thats it :)
I used Github.com to set up a repository, then I cloned this repository to my machine. Next, I'm gonna start building up the website. I'll list down here all that I do. Thanks for reading! Yay. 

I think im done! Yay
I made it similar (pretty far off) to the Google homepage. Things that could be improved/implemented:
- CSS on hover over elements
- Symbols for grid & email
- Nav bar at bottom (so hardd to position it & make the borders extend to full window size.
- Magnifying glass and voice control in Google
 Woo,,I'm tired..


PS: Special thanks to The Odin Project for being my guide through this. "http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css"
